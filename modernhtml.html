    <p>
      HTML entities are special codes used in HTML to represent particular
      characters that may have special meaning in HTML or may not be recognized
      by certain browsers. These characters include symbols, foreign or accented
      letters, mathematical symbols, and more. For example, the character "&" is
      a reserved character in HTML that is used to introduce an entity. To
      include an actual ampersand symbol in your HTML code without it being
      mistakenly interpreted as the start of an entity, you would use the HTML
      entity "&".

              <p>
                The tabindex attribute specifies the tab order of an element (when the "tab" button is used for navigating).

                The tabindex attribute can be used on any HTML element (it will validate on any HTML element. However, it is not necessarily useful).

                  Semantic HTML, also known as semantic markup, refers to the use of HTML tags that convey the meaning—or semantics—of the content contained within them.

                  By adding semantic HTML tags to your pages, you provide additional information that helps define the roles and relative importance of the different parts of your page.
